# ESPeciallyKerbal
An ESP32 companion program for KerbalSprigProgram that hosts a web UI to control Kerbal Space Program
# Instructions
1. download and open the sketch. You must configure the wifi setting yourself, however, the default settings for everything else should work if you use KerbalSprigProgramXtreme, which is the branch to use for wireless. Change your Authkey to your correct Authkey, otherwise you cannot use risky actions, like aborting your craft.
2. Connect the KerbalSprigProgram Sprig Controller to the game
3. Turn on the ESPeciallyKerbal device.
4. Access the mdns url, which should be http://kerbal-ui.local/, if you use default settings
5. Profit!
